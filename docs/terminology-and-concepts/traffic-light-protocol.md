# Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)

## Overview
The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) was developed by FIRST to enable easier sharing of potentially sensitive information to various individuals and groups. It is used extensively throughout Queensland Government, Federal Government, and other security partners.

## Definitions
### Community
A group that shares common goals, practices, and informal trust relationships (e.g., cyber security practitioners in Australia).

### Organisation
A group that shares common affiliation by formal membership, and are bound by common policies set by the organisation (e.g., Department of Customer Services, Open Data and Small and Family Business, Australian Cyber Security Centre).

### Clients
People or entities who receive services from an organisation.

## TLP Levels
