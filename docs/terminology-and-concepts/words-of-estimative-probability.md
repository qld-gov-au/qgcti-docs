# Words of Estimative Probability (WEPs)
## Overview
QGCTI utilises probability estimates and confidence levels in all products to enable stakeholders to take appropriate action based on intelligence and assessments. The basis of QGCTI's probability and confidence comes from the [NATO Allied Joint Doctrine for Intelligence Procedures](https://jadl.act.nato.int/ILIAS/data/testclient/lm_data/lm_152845/Linear/JISR04222102/sharedFiles/AJP21.pdf)

## Probability Estimate

| Highly Unlikely | Unlikely | Even Chance | Likely | Highly Likely |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| <10% | 10%-40% | 40%-60% | 60%-90% | >90% |

## Confidence Levels
| Low Confidence | Moderate Confidence | High Confidence |

| Our assessments are based on fragmentary information, from collection capabilities with dubious reliability, and low credibility. | Our assessments are based on evidence that is open to a number of interpretations or is credible but lacks correlation or corroboration. | Our assessments are based on high-quality information, with evidence from multiple collection capabilities, and corroboration from different sources. |
